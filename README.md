# Building a RESTful API with Nest.js: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

## Description

Welcome to our comprehensive Nest.js tutorial, where we'll guide you through the process of building a robust and scalable RESTful API from scratch. Nest.js is a powerful, TypeScript-based framework that's gained popularity for its ease of use and developer-friendly features.

In this hands-on tutorial, you'll embark on a journey to master the fundamentals of Nest.js. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to expand your skillset or a beginner eager to dive into backend development, this tutorial is designed to accommodate all levels of expertise.

### What You'll Learn

1. **Getting Started**: We'll begin by setting up a development environment and installing Nest.js. You'll learn about project structure and how Nest.js follows a modular architecture.

2. **Creating Controllers and Routes**: Explore the concept of controllers and routes in Nest.js. You'll understand how to define API endpoints and handle incoming requests.

6. **Database Integration**: Connect your API to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

7. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using libraries like Passport.js and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

8. **Error Handling**: Master error handling techniques to provide meaningful error responses to clients.

9. **Testing**: Write unit tests and end-to-end tests for your Nest.js application to ensure its reliability.

10. **Deployment**: Deploy your Nest.js application to popular cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

Throughout this tutorial, you'll work on a real-world project, building and enhancing your API step by step. By the end, you'll have the skills and confidence to create production-ready APIs with Nest.js, and you'll be well-equipped to tackle more advanced Nest.js concepts and projects.
